# Recipe Page ⭐️

Create a Odin Recipe page to showcase basic HTML & CSS.

# Thoughts 💭

This was the very first assignment with the updated Odin Project curriculum. I learned how to fill out the HTML boilerplate, create directory and files, navigate through the terminal, input headers, paragraphs, images, and links. Alongside, I was able to create ordered and unordered lists for my recipes. Played a bit with CSS hover. Most importantly, it was my fist time using Git and GitHub.
